# GEC Insider

We're a group of computer science students on a mission to create the ultimate platform for our college community to connect and discuss anything and everything â€“ anonymously.

Building an anonymous Reddit clone for our college (but way cooler).

Think Reddit, but tailored to the inside jokes, and campus happenings that define our college experience.
